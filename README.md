Background

I recently had an interesting challenge presented to me. I needed to introduce automated testing to a Q/A department with very little technical experience and no programming experience. 

This was really two (2) separate challenges. The first was to find the technologies to use to do the automated testing. The second was actually training the Q/A department. 

The article will only address the technologies used and what I learned in the process. 

The technologies worked well but I really had to search for information and spent many hours figuring out issues. There doesn't seem to be much on the Internet about this.
I wanted to share this information, so I wrote this article. I hope you find it useful. If you do, please let me know.
